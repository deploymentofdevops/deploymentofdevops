## SSH

SSH that amazing piece of software that allows us to talk to all up (mostly) linux machine across the world. Built cient-server most of us only really use it with a simple

```shell
ssh username@hostname
```

Anyone who has dug a bit deeper will know that there are a lot of options but todays option is -J

from the man page
```
-J destination
        Connect to the target host by first making a ssh connection to the jump host described by destination and then establishing a TCP forwarding to the ultimate destinationfrom there.  Multiple jump hops may be specified separated by comma characters.  This is a shortcut to specify a ProxyJump configuration directive.  Note that configuration directives supplied on the command-line generally apply to the destination host and not any specified jump hosts. Use ~/.ssh/config to specify configuration for jump
```

As you might have guessed this command allows to to get to a box through an intermediary (I dont know the history and if this is why its J but i always think of jump box when trying to remember it). If you are working in a cloud environment, which I hope that most people are, rather than just opening up all of your servers to the internet, things are generally hidden away with only a single server being used to get inot the environment. Often called Bastion/Jumpbox/pivot server to get into the servers that only have private IP addresses you would log into this box and then move to any of the internal boxes from there. This allows you to wrap this process into one command, so the middle login is invisible in the process.

```shell
ssh -J bastion-user@bastion-server internal-user@internalserver
```

Always remeber using your ssh config could make this even easier!
