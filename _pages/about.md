# What is Deployment Of DevOps

An idea born over a decade ago by an engineer like many others, lots of ideas and very little time.

As an engineer that discovered this new coined phrase, that very much aligned with his was of working, the idea behind getting the domain was to help engineers, managers and companies to understand what it was and what the processes were. Strangely, there was a lot of work in actually doing those things that stopped the site being created and built out to show case what it was.

## Why now

The tech industry is bigger than ever and shows no sign of shrinking, the tools and technologies have exploded over the nearly 10 years since the idea and then the domain was registered. Its difficult to keep up with everything. THis is an opportunity for myself, the guy with the original idea and some of the people that I have worked with to just get out there the things that we are playing with and learning so that others can learn and understand a little better themselves. While, for many who have been working the DevOps ways for a long while, there is still a lot of work to do in many organisations. REcent work has been focused on digital transformation. A fancy title that just means implementing things like Devops practices and its running mates of Agile methodologies and SRE, as many organisation, of different sizes, in all locations across the world, still haven't or have only just realised the importance of doing these things well as opposed to just paying lip service.

## What can we expect?

Not sure really but expect some tool comparisons, some how to and some commentary on things. Hopefully from a number of different engineers so you are likely to get different views on the same tools as things overlap. There is also some conversations around pushing things on to other platforms, YouTube shorts or twitch live building streams. Lets see where time, energy and the industry take us.
